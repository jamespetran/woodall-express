express things

not a lot of logic... but there is a lot of "setup"

this set up stuff is the same every single time => so that is good
its like 20 lines and if you forget something it just won't work...

kind of like $('onReady');

don't git push for now...

1. run in terminal:
      $ npm init --yes
            #####npm is a tool that helps us download other libraries
            this creates this file: package.json ðŸ‘ˆup on the left side
            "javascript object notation"

2. run in terminal:
      $ npm install express --save
            this adds approximately 1 million files to the folder browser
            also changes package.json
            and adds package-lock.json

3. add a ".git-ignore" file
      add the line "node_modules/" to stop all those node modules from getting uploaded to github


now i can git push
